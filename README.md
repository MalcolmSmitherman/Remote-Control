# Remote-Control
This Arduino project toggles and LED on and off when the power button of an IR remote control is pressed. You will need an IR sensor, and LED, an IR remote control, and some wires. The remote I used was an old IR remote that changed the colors of an LED strip. To get the code that any given button on the remote sends, simply open the serial monitor, press a button on the remote, and record the code that is sent. I just used the power button on the remote to keep things simple. You will then use that code to drive whatever action you desire. 
In the code I use a switch case so if I wanted to add more to the circuit in the future, editing the code would be fairly simple.
